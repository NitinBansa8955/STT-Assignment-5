# STT-Assignment-5
This is Assignment 5 of STT. Made by Nitin Bansal(23110223) ans Dhruv Goel(23110098) from Group Number 10.

Introduction -
In this assignment we have explored the data augmentation using the Augly tool by meta.

Procedure -
We were given a data of images of dogs and cats for classification.
Procedure -
We made the training and testing dataset out of it.
Procedure -
Augmented the training dataset 2 times to expand the training dataset by 3 times.
Procedure -
We used microsoft/resnet50 model for the classification. Firstly, we initialized the weights of the model.
Procedure -
Trained model once on training dataset and then again on the augemented training dataset.
Procedure -
Then tested on the test dataset.
